The Calgary Machine Learning Lab is a research group led by [Yani Ioannou](https://yani.ai) within the Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary. The lab has a research focus on improving Deep Neural Network (DNN) training and models, in particular for computer vision applications. Topics of research include: Sparse Neural Network Training, Bias and Robustness of Efficient Deep Learning methods and Domain-Agnostic Self-Supervised Learning.

We collaborate with other research groups within the university with the Artificial Intelligence Research Group, and broader, on applying machine learning and computer vision to novel problems.
