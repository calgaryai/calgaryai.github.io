**Calgary Artificial Intelligence (AI)** <br/>
The University of Calgary has many faculty members developing cutting-edge AI research. Calgary has a vibrant technology ecosystem with many startups and established companies using AI. The Calgary AI group was established in February 2022 to serve as a bridge to connect academia, industry, and the local community to promote AI research, education, and development. <br/>

Our group comprises a diverse set of researchers and research labs across multiple departments and faculties at the University of Calgary. Our mission is to develop high-impact research in AI, train the next generation of AI leaders and researchers, and give back to the local community of the city of Calgary.
