The Calgary Machine Learning Lab is a research group led by [Sayeh Bayat](/_people/sayeh_bayat.md) within the Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary.

The changing human-environment relationship reveals significant information about people's health and wellbeing. As mobile technology and digital information grow in our cities, new approaches to study the interconnectivity between the human-environment relationship and human health are emerging. 
At the same time, the worldwide urbanization process and the ageing population are representing new challenges for cities and governments. The cities are looking for ways to provide services to their citizens in an effective and efficient manner.
The mission of the Healthy City Lab – a research team at the University of Calgary directed by Dr. Sayeh Bayat – is to study this interconnectivity and work toward a framework of ubiquitous health for intelligent and sustainable solutions that support older adults and individuals with chronic diseases within cities.
