The changing human-environment relationship reveals significant information about people's health and wellbeing. As mobile technology and digital information grow in our cities, new approaches to study the interconnectivity between the human-environment relationship and human health are emerging. 
The mission of the Healthy City Lab – directed by Dr. Sayeh Bayat – is to study this inter-connectivity and work toward a framework of ubiquitous health for intelligent and sustainable solutions that support older adults and individuals with chronic diseases within cities.
